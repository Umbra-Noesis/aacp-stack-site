AACP Stack
==========

Advanced Adaptive Communication Protocol  
----------------------------------------

The AACP Stack (Advanced Adaptive Communication Protocol) is the foundational communication and reasoning framework of the Umbra-Noesis ecosystem.

AACP defines how cognition, intent, safety, and system behavior are exchanged between:

- Human users  
- EVAA Cognition  
- PCe (Personal Cognitive Environment)  
- E.V.E. Systems  
- Umbra Link  
- Umbra-Noesis OS  

It is the structured language that allows Umbra-Noesis to operate safely, predictably, and adaptively across all modules.

Purpose
-------

AACP is designed to:

- Provide a universal communication format for the entire ecosystem  
- Define how intent is interpreted into actionable cognitive structures  
- Maintain deterministic safety and behavioral rules  
- Enable modular expansion without breaking core communication logic  
- Support both local-first and hybrid distributed cognition  
- Serve as the backbone for Umbra-Noesis’ interoperability  

AACP ensures every subsystem speaks the same structured, safe, and adaptive language.

Part of the Umbra-Noesis Ecosystem
----------------------------------

The AACP Stack is integrated with:

- Umbra-Noesis Main Platform  
- EVAA Cognition Engine  
- PCe — Personal Cognitive Environment  
- E.V.E. Systems  
- Umbra Link  
- Umbra-Noesis OS  

All reasoning, interpretation, and cross-module communication flow through AACP.

Repository Contents
-------------------

index.html   – AACP introduction and specification overview  
CNAME        – Domain routing for aacp-stack.net  

Future additions will include:

- Full protocol specification  
- Layered architecture documentation  
- Intent interpretation standards  
- Safety and alignment structure  
- Developer tooling for AACP integration  
- Cross-module communication maps  

Status
------

AACP is in **active development** and represents the core protocol layer for all Umbra-Noesis technology.

This repository will expand to include:

- Official v1 specification  
- Protocol diagrams and examples  
- Implementation guidelines  
- Module compatibility definitions  
- Public release drafts  

AACP is the structured foundation upon which the whole ecosystem operates.
